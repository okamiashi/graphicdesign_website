                teach me some art skills. Though I doubt it.<br>
                <br>
                Other than that, I pretty much only one other goal: to get through. Whether that be this class, this school, this <i>life</i>, I wanna get through it.<br>
                Some of it will suck, some of it won't, but life is worth living. There's a lot to learn despite how much I've already learned. Though my smarts

                detail: `<h3>Yep. It's contrast. One of the most well-known and easily understood elements of design there is.</h3><br>
                Contrast is the difference in near elements. For example, the contrast between a person and the sky is big (skin and blue are very different colors),
                but the contrast between a person and a wall (often similar colors) are small.<br><br>
                Similar to balance, it's usually advised to keep contrast low. Though in some designs, contrast is important, like focusing on a target in an image,
                having a design pop out more, etc.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Example:</b><br>
                <img src='images/contrast.png' height=250px><br>
                <b>An example of contrast when it gets too high:</b><br><br>

                subtitle: 'When contrast is high intentionally',
                detail: `<h3>When contrast is intentionally high to make a part of the image more visible or noticeable.</h3><br>
                Emphasis is best used when you want something to stand out. Have a person you want to highlight? Put a dark background and shine a light on him.
                Have an item you want to contrast? Make the surrounding elements as different as possible, but similar to each other.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Example:</b><br>
                <img src='images/emphasis.jpg', height=350px><br>`

                subtitle: `Hey, I'm as confused as you on this one`,
                detail: `<h3>From what I understand of hierarchy, it isnt as complicated as it sounds, it just has a strange name.</h3><br>
                Hierarchy in design is how easily an image is processed. A super complicated image with about 7 different subjects is gonna be
                pretty bad as a logo or something you want the viewer to see and then leave.<br>
                <br>
                The reason it's called "hierarchy" is because it's referring to how 'important' each subject in an image is. So kinda similar to contrast, but 
                a little more important.<br>
                <br>
                It's best used when you have a specific item or subject in an image you want seen first, especially if there's a second you want them to see as well.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Example:</b><br>
                <img src='images/hierarchy.png' height=325px>`

                subtitle: 'The flow of an image<br>(wait how can an image move)',
                detail: `<h3>Movement refers to where the viewer's eye travels over a design.</h3><br>
                If you have a <a data-open-card="principles:hierarchy">hierarchy</a> of subjects in an image, how are you going to control where a viewer's eyes are going to 
                go first? Who's to say they won't look at the second one first? Or the third? Fifth?<br>
                <br>
                This is what movement is about. A design with good 'movement' should have a clear flow of where the subjects are and what to look at first, next, and last.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Example:</b><br>

                It is literally just a repeated design in an image. That is all a pattern is.<br>
                Seriously. I literally don't have anything more to write here. So example image it is.<br>
                <br>

                Obviously, making a bunch of a thing makes it very easy to see that thing. Horrible when overdone, though; usually used to just 'spice' an image up.<br>
